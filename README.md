**For Professor Lo**: there is a token in the appendix of our report submission on canvas.  

# Instructions for Running the App Locally (on macOS)
- Clone the repository and cd into it. 
- Put your access token in the token.txt file.
- Set up and activate a venv with python 3.12.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run `python3 setup_script.py`.
- You can now run the app locally using: ```python3 app.py``` It will be slow on the first time because it will have to download the model. 
- Anytime in the future you want to run the site just reactive the venv and run the `app.py` script.
